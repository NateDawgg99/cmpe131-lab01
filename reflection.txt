"In this lab, we worked with GitHub to set up repositories and learned how to commit and push our changes. One of the most useful things we covered was how to use branches when working on a team project. Branches let each person work on their own feature or fix without messing up the main code. It's like having your own personal workspace where you can try things out without worrying about breaking anything for the rest of the team. For example, while one person is adding a new feature in their branch, someone else can be fixing a bug in another, and neither has to worry about interfering with the other's work."
